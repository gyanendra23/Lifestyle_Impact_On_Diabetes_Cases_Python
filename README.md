📌 1. Project Overview

Diabetes is one of the fastest-growing global health concerns. Rising urbanization, sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary choices, and increasing obesity rates contribute to early metabolic disorders.

This project analyzes a rich multi-variable dataset of health, lifestyle, and demographic indicators to identify patterns associated with diabetes risk and help build actionable data insights.

The study spans:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Missing value handling

Outlier treatment

Feature categorization

Visual exploration

Risk factor identification

Machine Learning modeling

Final interpretation & recommendations

📊 2. Dataset Description

The dataset includes demographic, lifestyle, dietary, and clinical variables:

Key Columns

Age

Gender

Country & Region

BMI

Daily Calories (kcal)

Sugar Intake (g/day)

Alcohol Sessions per Week

Physical Activity Level

Blood Pressure (Systolic & Diastolic)

Fasting Glucose

Diabetes Status (No / Prediabetes / Type 2)

📌 Most Important Predictors

Fasting Glucose

BMI

Daily Calories

Sugar Intake

Physical Activity

Blood Pressure

🔍 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📈 3.1 Demographics

Mean age: 39.8 years

Balanced distribution across countries

Gender split: ~49% Male | ~49% Female | ~2% Others

Urban areas show significantly higher diabetes burden

🌍 Region Insights

Asia (32.6%) largest share

North America (25.3%) & Europe (21.3%) follow

Prediabetes is 6–8× higher than Type 2 Diabetes across all regions

USA, China, India → top 3 global hotspots

🍽 4. Lifestyle & Dietary Patterns
BMI

Mean BMI: 25.87

25–30% population overweight/obese

Strong correlation with glucose & BP

Calorie Intake

Mean: 2174 kcal/day

High-calorie groups show elevated diabetes risk

Sugar Intake

Mean: 55.8 g/day (far above WHO limits)

Highest risk in 51–75 g/day group

Physical Activity

Low/Moderate activity → highest diabetes burden

High activity → Protective effect

Diet Type

Plant-based (Vegetarian, Vegan, Pescatarian) → lowest risk

Omnivores → highest diabetes levels

🧪 5. Statistical Insights
Correlation Patterns

BMI ↗ → Glucose ↗ & BP ↗

Calories ↗ → BMI ↗ (r = 0.41)

Sugar intake alone not strongly correlated with BMI

Activity level negatively correlated with diabetes prevalence

Weight Category vs Glucose
Weight Status	Prediabetes Glucose	Type 2 Glucose
Underweight	97	107
Healthy	97	108
Overweight	97	110
Obese	98	111
🤖 6. Machine Learning Modeling
Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	73.28%
Random Forest	77.3%
XGBoost	77.66% (Best)
ML Observations:

Logistic Regression struggles with non-linear relationships

Tree-based & boosted models perform better

Class imbalance affects prediction of Type 2 Diabetes

Need for SMOTE / class weighting for improvement

🧭 7. Key Conclusions
Major Findings

Prediabetes is drastically higher than Type 2 → early-stage risk globally

BMI, calories, sugar & activity are strongest lifestyle predictors

Urban population faces much higher metabolic burden

Age 31–60 most vulnerable

Underweight groups also show elevated glucose → genetic or poor nutrition factors

Ensemble models (RF, XGBoost) best for prediction

Overall Message

Diabetes is highly preventable when early lifestyle interventions are applied.
